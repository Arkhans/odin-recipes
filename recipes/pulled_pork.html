    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pulled pork is an American barbecue dish, more specifically a dish of the Southern U.S., based on shredded barbecued pork shoulder.</p>
    <p>It is typically slow-smoked over wood; indoor variations use a slow cooker.</p>
    <h2 class="left">Ingredients</h2>
    <h3 class="left">Yield 12 servings</h3>
    <ul class="left">
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 medium mugfuls of cider</li>
        <li>boneless shoulder of pork (about 2.5kg)</li>
        <li>a mugful of a good smoky barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>soft white rolls</li>
        <li>coleslaw</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="left">Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="left">
        <li>Mix together 2 tsp each smoked paprika, ground cumin, pepper, and brown sugar, plus 1 tsp salt. Rub over the 2.5kg boneless shoulder of pork.</li>
        <li>Put the pork in a big casserole dish, skin-side up, and pour in 2 medium mugfuls of cider.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and cook in the oven at 150C/130C fan/gas 2 for anywhere between 4 and 8 hrs until falling apart. Check every few hours in case it gets dry – if it does, add another mugful of cider.</li>
        <li>Take it out of the oven and put the meat in a big dish, leaving the liquid in the casserole.</li>
        <li>Cut the skin off, then shred the meat using two forks. Ditch any fatty bits, and skim any excess fat off the surface of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a mugful of a good smoky BBQ sauce to the casserole, mix it in, then ladle some into a bowl for dipping.</li>
        <li>Put the pulled pork back in the casserole with the juices so it stays moist. Season to taste. Can be made one day ahead.</li>
        <li>Serve in soft white rolls with coleslaw and the bowl of juices on the side for ‘French dipping’ the sandwich while you’re eating.</li>
